# Blog CRUD - A React Native Learning Project

This is a basic React Native application I built to learn the fundamentals of fetching data with hooks and managing state with \`useContext\`. 

**Features:**

*   Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.
*   Fetches blog post data from an API (not included - you'll need to set up your own).
*   Uses custom hooks for data fetching.
*   Utilizes \`useContext\` for global state management.

**Note:** This app prioritizes functionality over visual design. The main focus was on learning core React Native concepts.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository`
2.  Install dependencies: \`npm install\`
3.  Start the app: \`npm start\`

## Technologies Used

*   React Native
*   \`useContext\`
*   Custom Hooks

## Learning Outcomes

*   Creating and using custom hooks for data fetching.
*   Implementing global state management with \`useContext\`.
*   Building basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in React Native.
